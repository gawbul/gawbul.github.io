I’m Steve Moss, a scientist, technologist, and engineer. I grew up in a small seaside town in the United Kingdom.

My focus is on engineering [distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) in production. I’m currently exploring the applications of AI in creating reliable, scalable, and efficient systems.

Previously, I worked in bioinformatics and comparative genomics with a focus on genome evolution. I did so at various universities and research institutions across the globe, including the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/) and the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/).

Working in research taught me many things about running reliable and reproducible analyses on large-scale [high-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) systems that has been particularly relevant to my work in industry. I have tried to bring the benefit of that experience to the companies I now work with.

I graduated from the University of Hull, where I taught bioinformatics and Linux skills to staff and students as part of the [Lunt Lab](https://www.davelunt.net/). It is my aim to use the content of the courses I taught as the foundation for several blog posts and articles on [this site](https://www.gawbul.io/). You can view my thesis [here](https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/4217868).

My current focus is on advancing my knowledge of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To that end I have become a contributor to the [Kubernetes community](https://www.kubernetes.dev/), participating in discussions and aiming to enable the smooth running of the infrastructure as part of [SIG K8s-Infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-k8s-infra). It is my goal to become a Kubernetes expert by gaining the knowledge needed to achieve all certifications required for the [Kubestronaut program](https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/).

I’m active on [GitHub](https://github.com/gawbul) and aspire to become a tech blogger on [this site](https://www.gawbul.io/). You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KD8T2ZwAAAAJ&hl=en).

I enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. [Reach out](mailto:gawbul@gmail.com) if you want to find a way to work together!
